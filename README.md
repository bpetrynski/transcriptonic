# FAQs

**1. Can I change the language of the transcript?**

Yes. TranscripTonic picks up the output of Google Meet captions. Google Meet captions supports variety of languages that you can choose from. Click the settings icon when captions start showing and change the language.

**2. I did not get any transcript at the end of the meeting.**

This could happen when:
1. New errors caused by Google Meet updates
2. Any unexpected events like network drop, browser crashes etc.

When this happens, it might be possible to recover the transcript, but recovery should be done before starting another meeting.
- Open the extension and click on "last 10 meetings". Click on "Recover last meeting" button present after the table.
- TranscripTonic will also attempt to auto-recover any missed transcripts, just before a new meeting starts.
